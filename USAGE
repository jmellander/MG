=== USAGE ===

Sumstats provides summary statistics (generally of network events) on a periodic basis.

Non-probabilistic SumStats obserations are made with a Key (either a host IP address, or a string) and an Observation (either a numeric value, or a string).  Each distinct Key creates a table on every worker that takes an Observation on that Key.

Probabilistic SumStats policies (HLL - HyperLogLog, TopK, and this one, MG) necessarily use an internal data structure to store their data, and a Key is not used, as this would obviate the memory advantages of using these policies.  HLL & TopK both take unit observations, and push their input to SumStats via the string Observation$str. MG uses Observation$str in place of the key & Observation$num to store the value.  Below are some examples for clarity:

Non-probabilistic SumStats:
SumStats::observe( "MySumStats", [$host=my_host], [$num=bytes] );

HLL or TopK probabilistic:
SumStats::observe( "MySumStats", [], [$str=fmt("%s",my_host)] );

MG probabilistic SumStats:
SumStats::observe( "MySumStats", [], [$str=fmt("%s",my_host), $num=bytes] );


The key difference between MG & the other probabilistic policies is that it allows an amount (typically a byte-count) to be observed along with
